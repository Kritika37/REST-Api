# RESTFUL API using Node.js



=======

Handling Errors in our API
1. Instead of starting server again and again after any updation download a package called npm install --save-dev nodemon
This basically automatically restart our server whenever we change anything

2.Added nodemon save dev so that we do not need to restart the server again and again after making changes.
